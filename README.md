There are many ways to measure temperature, but the three most common units of temperature measurement are Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit.
On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point and boiling point of water are defined as 32° and 212°F, with 180 degrees divided between them.
The celsius scale is based on the freezing and boiling points of water at a pressure of 1 atm, which are 0° and 100°C respectively.
The Kelvin unit is defined as the distance between absolute zero and the triple point of water.
If the temperature is in kelvin, use the following formulas to calculate celsius and fahrenhiet.
Celsius = (Kelvin – 273.15);
Fahrenhiet = 1.8 *(Kelvin -273.15) + 32.0;
If the temperature is in Celsius, use the following formulas to calculate Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
Kelvin = (Celsius + 273.15);
Fahrenhiet = (Celsius * 1.8) + 32.0;
If the temperature is in Fahrenheit, use the following formulas to calculate Celsius and Kelvin.
Kelvin = (Fahrenhiet – 32.0) * 0.555555 +273.15;
Celsius = (Fahrenhiet – 32.0) * 0.555555;
